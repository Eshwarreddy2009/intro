<div><p>For nearly two decades, one of the world’s most infamous hacker groups has operated under the name “Anonymous.” And the mysterious online community is making headlines once again.

After Russia invaded Ukraine at the end of February, a Twitter account with 7.9 million followers named “Anonymous” declared a “cyber war” against Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin. Since then, the group has claimed responsibility for various cyberattacks that disabled websites and leaked data from Russian government agencies, as well as state-run news outlets and corporations.

Often called “hacktivists,” Anonymous employs coordinated cyberattacks against various world governments, corporations or other groups, often in the name of social or political causes. In a Feb. 24 tweet, the “Anonymous” account — which says it “cannot claim to speak for the whole of the Anonymous collective” — called on hackers around the world, including in Russia, to “say ‘NO’ to Vladimir Putin’s war.”</p>

<h3>Anonymous origins</h3>
<div><p>Anonymous’ origin story begins in the online message forums of 4chan, the anonymous social community website founded in 2003. Even today, posts on 4chan from users who don’t specify a username are labeled as written by “Anonymous.”

In the website’s early days, users often organized group pranks called “raids,” flooding chat rooms in games and other online communities to cause disruptions. 4chan began cracking down on the raids after critics accused participants of cyberbullying and posting offensive content.

Those raids formed the basis of Anonymous’ operations: a decentralized movement of like-minded online users who would communicate in encrypted chat rooms to plan online disruptions. At first, those plans were largely about cheap entertainment. Eventually, they began to revolve around social or political aims.</div></p>

<h3>Philosophy and targets</h3>
<div><p>
Generally, Anonymous opposes governments and corporations that it views as participating in censorship or promoting inequality. Since the group is decentralized, it has no real structure or hierarchy — so there’s often much internal debate about which ideas or causes to support.

A pinned 2019 tweet on the @YourAnonNews Twitter account – which, again, claims not to speak for the collective as a whole – describes Anonymous members as “working class people seeking a better future for humanity.” It lists Anonymous’ guiding principles as “freedom of information, freedom of speech, accountability for companies and governments, privacy and anonymity for private citizens.”</div></p>


<h3>Supporters and critics</h3>
<div><p>
In 2012, Time magazine named Anonymous one of the world’s 100 Most Influential People. Today, millions of people follow Anonymous-affiliated social media accounts.

Jeremiah Fowler, a co-founder of the cybersecurity company Security Discovery, told CNBC last week that Anonymous’ supporters likely view the group as somewhat of a “cyber Robin Hood,” targeting powerful governments and corporations in the name of popular causes.

“You want action now, you want justice now, and I think groups like Anonymous and hacktivists give people that immediate satisfaction,” Fowler said.

But Anonymous definitely has critics. Many believe the group’s vigilante tactics are extreme and potentially dangerous. In 2012, the National Security Agency deemed Anonymous a threat to national security.

Parmy Olson, a journalist who wrote a 415-page book on Anonymous in 2012, stated at the time that even the group’s supporters should consider its legacy a mixed bag.

“Has Anonymous done good for the world? In some cases, yes,” Olson told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, citing Anonymous’ support of pro-democracy demonstrators in the Middle East. “Unnecessarily harassing people? I would class that as a bad thing. DDOSing the CIA website, stealing customer data and posting it online just for sh-ts and giggles is not a good thing.”</div></p>
